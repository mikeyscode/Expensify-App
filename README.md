## Expensify App
This project was created while following Andrew Mead's [The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/). If you're interested in learning about React I really do reccomend taking a look at the course because I've found it extremely valuable in improving my knowledge and understanding of React and a lot of the complimenting items around it such as webpack.
